        <h2>Yuna Kim</h2>
        <img src="./img/YuNaKimInVancouver.jpg" height= "200" style="left">
        <p>
            Yuna Kim is often referred to as the GOAT (Greatest of all time) female figure skater. This is because she has textbook jumping technique and won Gold in the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics and Silver in the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, and recently she lit the final Olympic torch at the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics. She is the most successful figure skater from South Korea and inspired many South Koreans to take up the sport as a result. I am inspired by her dedication to figure skating and her courage to be one of first figure skaters to compete internationally for South Korea.

        <img src="./img/5aa6a60a15e9f91e647f992e.jpg" height= "200" style="left">
        <p>
            Alexandra Trusova, who is aged 16, is often referred to as the Quad Queen. This is because she was on of the first female ladies to land a quadruple jump (4 turns in the air) in a competition, and feat once thought to be impossible for ladies to successfully land when she was only 13. She continues to successfully land different types of quad jumps in competition and is often artibuted with developing the difficulty level of ladies competition. I am inspired by her continuing hard work to complete once thought impossible challenges regardless of age.

        <h2>Surya Bonaly</h2>
        <img src="./img/surya-bonaly-477-no-tights.jpg" height= "200" style="left">
        <p>
            Surya Bonaly is perhaps based known for being the first person to complete a backflip and landing it on one foot. This move is banned in competition, and Surya performed it anyway at the Nagano 1998 Winter Olympics. I am inspired by her because of her fearlessness and courage in the face of diversity.
